# greenfield-my-basket-diaries

This project is a web application for making diary entries about food. The diary entries are shared with everybody and can be added/deleted/edited (CRUD) on the website.

## Tech Stack

- Project Structure: Monolith/ MVC
- Programming Language: JavaScript
- Frontend Library: React
- Backend Framework: Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase (picture storage)
- Styling: CSS, MUI
- Build Tools: Vite
- Testing: Jest

## Installation

- Prerequisites: Firebase account (https://firebase.google.com/)
- Create a PostgreSQL database with the name: `cc_greenfield`
- Install dependencies
  - Server: `npm install`
  - Client: `npm install`
- Change `env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholders

- Development:
  - Server: `npm run express-dev`
  - Client: `npm run dev`
  - Test: `npm test`

## Documentation

The backend utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure.

Middlewares used:

- express.json: parsing incoming requests and responses
- cors: managing cross-origin requests and responses
- auth: protecting endpoints with JSON WEBTOKENS stored in LOCAL STORAGE

Model:

- Using Knex to connect to the PostgreSQL database

View:

- Login/Creating User endpoints
- The DIARY endpoints are all protected by the authentication middleware that utilizes the cookie session

Controller:

- Handling verification of requests like valid email or already existing users

Testing:


- For Testing, we use Jest to run tests for User creation. Further tests will be added soon.
- For Testing Login, there is a bug that the test is failing upon entering correct user data. This is not the case as it has been manually tested. We suspect some race condition happening in the Controller.

Front-end:

- We have used the Web bundler with Vanilla JavaScript and React.
- The application structure is the following:

```
Client
    -MAIN JSX
        -"/",LOGIN.jsx
        -"diary" , App.jsx
        -"*", Error.jsx

APP - Header - User profile
    - Dashboard - File Upload
                - Masonry
                    - Edit Modal
                    - Card
                        -Love
                        -EDIT
                        -DELETE

```

Styling:


- We are using a 3rd Party Library: Material-UI (MUI)
- Pre-built CSS components to style the pages
- You are able to configure the components: https://mui.com/

Additional Information:

- The backend follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model (data access layer), the View (user interface layer), and the Controller (application logic layer).
- The middleware functions are used to handle various tasks, such as session management, request parsing, CORS handling, and authentication.
- The Model layer uses Knex.js, a SQL query builder for Node.js, to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- The View layer handles the rendering of the user interface, including the login/signup pages and the protected diary endpoints.
- The Controller layer manages the application logic, including user authentication and request validation.
- The testing framework used is Jest, which is a popular JavaScript testing framework.
- The front-end is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vanilla JavaScript for additional functionality.
- The application structure follows a standard React application structure, with separate components for different parts of the application.
- The styling is handled using Material-UI (MUI), a popular React UI framework that provides pre-built components and styles.
- The documentation mentions that you can configure the MUI components according to your needs by visiting the official MUI documentation.
